This library just provides stubs for the signal-related functions and syscalls
to allow applications to run that do not dependent on a working signal
implementation.

This library replaces the previous `uksignal` implementation that is no longer
working with the new scheduling and thread APIs. A new implementation will be
part of a future release.
